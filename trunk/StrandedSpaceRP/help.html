<h2>Needs</h2>

<p>You need food, water and sleep to survive. You can track all three stats, as well as your health,<br />
by looking at the HUD box in the top left corner.</p>

<span style = "color: rgb(170,0,0);"><p>Health</p></span>
<span style = "color: rgb(0,170,0);"><p>Food</p></span>
<span style = "color: rgb(0,0,1700);"><p>Water</p></span>
<span style = "color: rgb(170,0,140);"><p>Sleep</p></span>

<p>If you lack any stat below zero, you will lose health,
and eventually die. To get food, simply press use on anything edible. It will instantly increase<br />
your food gauge, and also a little health. To get water, stand in a body of water and press use.<br />
To sleep, use the sleep command from the F3 menu. Make sure you are in a shelter before going to sleep!</p>
